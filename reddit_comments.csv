At the moment they invest, the IRS considers it to be earned ordinary income that is taxed at 40%, meaning he'd be on the hook for a gargantuan tax bill of $90M. To avoid that, a portion of his shares were withheld to accomodate the taxes. This was done simultaneously with the vesting, because if the stock dives for any reason you get royally screwed. Tax planning 101. Also, by vesting in the $40s vs the $60s where DKNG was trading at, Robbins saved almost $40M in taxes, because any appreciation from $40s from this point forward means he'll be taxed instead at a capital gains rate of 15%. Insiders were thus motivated to have a lower stock price on the day of vesting on 10/20.
